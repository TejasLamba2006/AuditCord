**What is AuditCord?**

AuditCord is a small, fast plugin that tells you **what Minecraft client a player is using when they join your server**.  
That’s it. No complicated setup. No extra plugins. No tech headache.

If you’ve ever wondered  
“Are my players using vanilla, Lunar, Fabric, or something sketchy?”  
AuditCord answers that instantly.

**Why you’d actually want this**

Most servers don’t need fancy anti-cheats.  
They just want **awareness and control**.

AuditCord helps you:

- Know what clients players are joining with
- Get alerts when someone joins using a suspicious client
- Block unwanted clients if you want
- Keep staff informed without spamming chat
- Log joins to Discord if you run a community server

It’s built for **real servers**, including low-end VPS setups.

**What information AuditCord can log**

When enabled, AuditCord can send a clear join report to Discord for staff to review.
This is optional and fully controlled by you.

A join report may include:

- Player name and UUID  
- Client or launcher used  
- Minecraft version  
- World and dimension  
- Player coordinates  
- Game mode  
- Health  
- Ping  
- IP address  
- Server version  
- Online player count  
- Exact join timestamp  

This helps staff quickly understand who joined, how they joined, and from where — without logging into the server.

Nothing here modifies gameplay.  
Nothing is hidden.  
Everything shown is information the server already has.

If you don’t want Discord logging, it can be disabled completely.

**What makes AuditCord different**

A lot of similar plugins depend on heavy libraries that slow servers down.  
AuditCord doesn’t.

- No ProtocolLib  
- No required addons  
- No extra downloads  

Drop it in, restart, done.

This keeps:

- Startup faster
- Memory usage lower
- Lag risk minimal

Especially useful for SMPs, small networks, and budget servers.

---

**Things it can do (without complexity)**

- Detect common clients like Vanilla, Fabric, Forge, Lunar, Badlion, Feather, LabyMod, and more  
- Alert staff when players join with specific clients  
- Allow or block clients using a simple list  
- Rename how client names appear (for cleaner messages)  
- Send join logs to a Discord webhook (optional)  
- View who’s online and what client they’re using  

Everything is configurable, but nothing is forced.

**Who this plugin is for**

AuditCord is for you if:

- You run an SMP or community server
- You want visibility, not invasive anti-cheat
- You care about performance
- You don’t want dependency drama

If you just want to **know what’s connecting to your server**, this fits.

**Installation (no nonsense)**

1. Download the plugin  
2. Put it in the plugins folder  
3. Restart the server  

No dependencies. No setup wizard. No surprises.
